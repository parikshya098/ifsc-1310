    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p> 
      Creating a website is a whole new experience for me. I never imagined I'd be creating a website in my life. But I'm glad I took this course. I initially believed it would be tough for me to learn the necessary programming languages, but with Mr. Thomas Wallace as the instructor, everything turned out to be fantastic. When I showed my sister my project, she claimed I could have done better. I know I need to work harder to improve my skills, but I had an incredible opportunity to learn a lot of new things about front-end development from Mr. Wallace.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>
      Progressive enhancement is a design strategy that provides users with functions and content while also providing the greatest user experiences possible with updated browsers that can run all needed code. It provides various device-implemented functions and assists in software upgrades. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Progressive enhancement is important in the modern web development because it facilitates in the development of application software or websites that can be utilized by as many devices as needed while also being able to adapt and add new features. It focuses on the beginning of our project utilizing only the most fundamental web technologies before implementing more complicated features. Progressive enhancement assists us in establishing a solid base for our project by aligning our HTML, CSS, and JS and aiming to give fallbacks. Pages created using the this strategy ensure that fundamental contents areÂ always available to search engine spiders and ready to be retrieved.
